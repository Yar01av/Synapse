TODO:
> EpsilonGreedy selector should conform to the ABC
> StepsGenerators don't follow single responsibility
> Action selectors violate the abstract interface by allowing the batching
> Training loops should not be creating their own environments
> Training loops should output the model. The selector will be chosen outside.
> The demo loop should be simplified.
> Rewrite util.py

> Make training restartable
> Parametrize the training with the environment and the model
> make .train return a selector
